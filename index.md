## About Me 
Hi, my name is Ansh. I'm 14 years old and have lived in San Diego my entire life. I'm currently a freshman in Del Norte High School. My family is from India, so Indian culture has been a big part of my life. Like nearly every other Indian in the US, my interests lie in computer sciences, though, I'm slightly oriented towards liberal arts. Outside of school, I enjoy extracurricular and volunteer work. I compete in several team cybersecurity competitions, my job pertaining to network engineering. I'm currently in pursuit of a CCNA certificate to pursue that interest further. As for the volunteering, I teach English to IIT students online and do some backend work for an NGO called "Talk to Me India."
