<p style="font-family:Gill Sans; font-size:18px;">I definitely met my goals. I've become somewhat familiar with all the functions in CSS and HTML, while learning how to impliments elements of Java. My improvement since has been drastic, as I've gone from the one begging for help to the one everyone needs help from. The week was successful in that I completed the assignment to an insane degree and began work on the next assignment, which I'd estimate is about 80% done already. Overall a productive week, and I'm genuinely proud of my progress in the class.</p>
