<p style="font-family:Gill Sans; font-size:18px;">This week, I (obviously) plan on completing the assignment. Though, the assignment shouldn't more than a day. Thus, my plan is to mess with the CSS a bit to make the website more tailored to my preferred aesthetic. My goal is to become more familiar with the CSS, begin implimenting Javascript elements, attempt basic animations, and generally improve my understanding of the webpage as a whole. If time permits, I'd like to begin work on next week's assignment with the newfound udnerstanding of Java. Considering that this project isnt to be taken too seriously, I'd like to get to the point where I may have fun with it.
