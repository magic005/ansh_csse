<p style="font-family:Gill Sans; font-size:18px;">This week, I (obviously) plan on completing the assignment. Though, the assignment shouldn't more than a day. Thus, my plan is to mess with the CSS a bit to make the website more tailored to my prefered aesthetic. I'd like to add a background gradient, and change the color/font of text headers. </p>
